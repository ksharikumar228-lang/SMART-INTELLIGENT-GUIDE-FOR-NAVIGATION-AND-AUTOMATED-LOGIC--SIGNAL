Project Vision
The primary goal of SIGNAL is to reduce the immense physical burden on traffic police officers while ensuring a seamless, high-tech traffic flow. By replacing traditional manual monitoring with an AI-driven "Human-like" decision-making system, this project ensures that traffic moves dynamically based on real-time density rather than static timers.
Core System Architecture & Sensor Logic
1. Smart Density & FIFO Management (Inductive Loop & Visual Sensors)
Traditional signals often force drivers to wait for 120 seconds per side, leading to a total cycle time of nearly 480 seconds (8 minutes) at a junction.
The SIGNAL Solution: Utilizing a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) methodology combined with density analysis.
The system monitors vehicle entry 100 meters before the junction.
It calculates the exact number of vehicles and adjusts the Green light duration dynamically. No more standing in the heat for 8 minutes; if the road is clear, the system releases the next lane immediately.
Fail-Safe Mode: If sensors fail, the system automatically reverts to a standard timer mode to ensure traffic never comes to a complete halt.
2. The AI Traffic Controller (Violation & Instruction System)
This sensor acts as a digital police officer with the power to instruct and penalize.
Visual Tracking: It monitors if a vehicle crosses the stop line or causes an obstruction.
Voice Instructions: If a driver blocks the road, the AI gives three verbal warnings (8-second instruction + 2-second pause).
Automated Penalty: If the driver does not move after 30 seconds of instruction, the system automatically issues a fine at the 36th second.
Inter-Signal Communication: If a violator escapes one junction, the AI transmits the vehicle number and offense details to the next signal in the network, ensuring the violator is intercepted by the next police post.
3. Emergency Response & Trauma Shield (Hybrid Sensing)
The system uses a combination of Visual (Camera) and Vibration (Impact) sensors to detect accidents instantly.
Instant Verification: It confirms a collision by cross-referencing visual data with impact sound/vibration.
E-FIR & EMS: Upon confirmation, it automatically generates an E-FIR for the police and triggers a CODE RED Trauma Alert to the nearest hospital.
Legal Protection: If a driver breaks a signal to save a life (Emergency), they have 6 hours to report it via an app; otherwise, the AI-generated fine remains valid.
4. Animal & Hazard Warning System
To prevent accidents before they happen, the AI detects animals (cows, dogs) or road hazards (slippery roads, school zones) approaching the junction.
Voice Alerts: It broadcasts specific warnings to drivers (e.g., "Animal approaching from North").
Prevention: This reduces the reaction time for drivers, turning a potential fatal accident into a controlled stop.
